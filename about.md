### João Ricardo Mattos e Silva  

#### 24/05/1988 @ Florianópolis, SC - Brazil

**I am a Software Developer passionate with simple, easy growing solutions.**  
I have a BSc in Computer Science and have been involved with software for 7+ years, mostly as a backend developer.

I believe that only when different points of view and skills work together, that something good is achievable, and I enjoy being part of a small team working to create something great.  


## What I do  
 - Build restful APIs with python and javascript web frameworks.
 - Work with distributed services for asynchronous tasks on a microservices architecture.
 - Create scripts for watching, scraping and parsing raw data to objects.
 - Backend and design integration, with frontend javascript frameworks.
 - Work with a continuous integration environment.
 - Use cloud services for deploying and monitoring projects.
 - Packaging applications, from requirements to containers.
 - Scripts for development and deployment tasks.
 - Create automated tests.
 - Use best practices, architectures and design patterns.

## What I Use
 - **Python**, Django (DRF), Celery, Tornado, Twisted
 - Javascript, Node.js, Angular, jQuery, Gulp
 - Nginx, RabbitMQ, Docker
 - Redis, MongoDB
 - Jenkins, TravisCI, API Blueprint
 - Linux, Git
 - AWS, Digital Ocean, Heroku
 - Social Networks and others third party APIs


## What I Like
Being part of a team of people with different skillsets, creating a product well built in all bases.  
  
Work with more experienced people, learning while working, as well as passing what I've learned to others.  
  
A well managed project, with defined tasks and estimatives, but with room for changes and quick responses.  
  
Brainstorms and meetings to discuss about the product as a whole.

Refactoring a big chunk of code into something less complex, more generic and simple to use.  
  
I also enjoy photography, hiking/camping, cooking, music, games and to ride my bike to work everyday.
